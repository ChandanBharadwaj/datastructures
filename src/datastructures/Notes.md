Java provides several concurrent collections that are part of the `java.util.concurrent` package. These collections are thread-safe and designed for concurrent access in multithreaded environments. Below is a list of concurrent collections available in Java 8 and onwards:

### 1. **ConcurrentHashMap**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe, highly performant version of `HashMap`. It allows concurrent access by partitioning the map into segments and locking only the affected segment when performing updates.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`
     - Supports atomic operations like `putIfAbsent()`, `compute()`, `merge()`

### 2. **ConcurrentSkipListMap**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe, sorted map that supports concurrent access. It is based on a skip list and maintains a natural ordering or a specified comparator.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`
     - Operations like `firstEntry()`, `lastEntry()` for accessing the sorted entries

### 3. **ConcurrentSkipListSet**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe, sorted set implementation based on `ConcurrentSkipListMap`. It supports concurrent access and maintains elements in their natural or specified order.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`
     - Sorted operations like `first()`, `last()`

### 4. **CopyOnWriteArrayList**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe version of `ArrayList` where every modification (add, set, or remove) results in a new copy of the underlying array. It is ideal for scenarios where reads vastly outnumber writes.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `add()`, `remove()`, `get()`
     - Traversing operations are done on a snapshot of the list.

### 5. **CopyOnWriteArraySet**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe set based on `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, which does not allow duplicate elements. It follows the same copying strategy during updates, suitable for read-heavy scenarios.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`

### 6. **BlockingQueue**
   - **Description**: An interface that represents a thread-safe queue that supports operations like waiting for space to become available (`put()`) and waiting for elements to appear (`take()`).
   - **Implementations**:
     - **ArrayBlockingQueue**: A fixed-capacity blocking queue backed by an array.
     - **LinkedBlockingQueue**: A potentially unbounded queue, optionally bounded, backed by linked nodes.
     - **PriorityBlockingQueue**: An unbounded, priority-based blocking queue where elements are ordered based on their priority (natural or custom).
     - **SynchronousQueue**: A special blocking queue that has no capacity. Every `put()` must wait for a corresponding `take()`, and vice versa.
     - **DelayQueue**: A specialized blocking queue where elements are delayed until they become eligible for retrieval.

### 7. **LinkedTransferQueue**
   - **Description**: A highly concurrent queue optimized for producers to transfer data to consumers. It supports both `offer()` and `transfer()`, where the `transfer()` method blocks until a consumer receives the element.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `offer()`, `poll()`, `take()`, `transfer()`

### 8. **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe, unbounded, non-blocking queue that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is suitable for high-performance, low-latency, multi-threaded applications.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `offer()`, `poll()`, `peek()`

### 9. **ConcurrentLinkedDeque**
   - **Description**: A thread-safe, unbounded, non-blocking deque (double-ended queue) that supports insertions and removals from both ends. It is ideal for work-stealing algorithms.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `offerFirst()`, `offerLast()`, `pollFirst()`, `pollLast()`

### 10. **BlockingDeque**
   - **Description**: An interface that extends `Deque` and `BlockingQueue`. It is a blocking, double-ended queue where operations like inserting, removing, and retrieving elements can block if necessary.
   - **Implementations**:
     - **LinkedBlockingDeque**: A linked-list-based implementation of `BlockingDeque` with optional bounded capacity.

### 11. **ConcurrentNavigableMap**
   - **Description**: An interface that extends `NavigableMap` and `ConcurrentMap`, providing a thread-safe, sorted map with operations that navigate the sorted entries.
   - **Key Implementation**:
     - **ConcurrentSkipListMap**

### 12. **NavigableSet**
   - **Description**: Although not inherently concurrent, `ConcurrentSkipListSet` is the most commonly used concurrent implementation for sorted, navigable sets.

These concurrent collections help in simplifying multi-threaded programming, avoiding the need for explicit synchronization and providing better performance in highly concurrent scenarios.
